# DailyLogger 📝🚀

DailyLogger is a simple personal desktop application built with **Electron + Node.js** that helps you maintain a **daily developer log** and automatically commit meaningful updates to a GitHub repository.

Instead of fake or automated commits, this tool encourages **real daily reflection**:
- What you learned today
- What you built or explored
- What you plan to do next

Your GitHub contribution graph stays green **naturally**, backed by real content.

## ✨ Why DailyLogger?

Many developers want to:
- Stay consistent with daily learning
- Build a habit of reflection
- Keep their GitHub activity active in an honest way

DailyLogger solves this by turning your **daily notes into real Git commits**.

No gimmicks. No fake scripts. Just real progress.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “If it’s on GitHub, it should mean something.”

Every commit created by DailyLogger represents:
- A real learning session
- A real thought
- A real day of progress

If someone inspects your commits, they’ll find **actual notes**, not noise.
